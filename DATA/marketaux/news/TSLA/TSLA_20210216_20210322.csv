ca7e3f34-53cc-4e56-8a57-1ede0fb6bacd,Uber Suffers Blow As UK Court Says Drivers Entitled To Worker Rights – Report,"Uber suffered a blow on Friday after the UK’s Supreme Court ruled that a group of the ride-hailing company’s drivers are entitled to worker rights, including minimum wage, Reuters reported. According to the Reuters report, a total of 25 Uber (UBER) drivers were part of the case and Uber said the verdict did not apply to all of its current 60,000 drivers in Britain, including 45,000 in London. Currently, these drivers are considered as self-employed. As a result, they are entitled to only minimal protections by law in the UK – a status that Uber sought to maintain in the legal tussle. Reuters cited UK Supreme Court Judge George Leggatt, “The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Uber’s appeal. The legislation is intended to give certain protections to vulnerable individuals who have little or no say over their pay and working conditions.” Uber’s Northern and Eastern Europe head Jamie Heywood was quoted by Reuters, “We respect the Court’s decision which focused on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.” (See Uber stock analysis on TipRanks) Shares of Uber fell by 1% and closed at $58.39 on Feb. 19. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $76 (30% upside potential) on the stock. Following UK’s Supreme Court ruling, Ives commented in a note to investors, “With London one of Uber’s Top 5 markets globally this ruling clearly could change this market depending on the ripple impact for the company as the employee route (minimum wage, paid time off and vacations) revives a nightmare for Uber and the overall Gig Economy…” “For Uber heading into a ridesharing rebound, the company needs to carefully balance how they navigate this latest legal challenge to the worker vs. contractor debate which remains a lingering overhang globally…We believe this UK ruling is a contained risk at this point for Uber and the overall Gig Economy, with the city of London and Uber having many battles throughout the past few years (licenses, etc) with this the latest issue,” Ives added. Overall, analysts are bullish on the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. This is based on 26 analysts recommending a Buy and 3 analysts suggesting a Hold. The average analyst price target of $71.46 implies 22.4% upside potential to current levels.

The service will be moved to so-called providers of last resort to avoid a disruption, allocated by state’s Public Utility Commission’s “mass transition process.”The Macquarie Energy-backed company said previously it would challenge the prices set by the grid operator during the crisis and its chief executive officer, Michael Fallquist, declined to testify at Texas legislative hearings Friday.Griddy said in a statement Friday that the decision on pricing was made “to take the price out of the hands of the market,” adding that “we wanted to continue the fight for our members to get relief and that hasn’t changed.”(Adds comment on moving services to providers of last resort in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",,"Benzinga

ad68b220-b835-429e-98ab-81cd7436903a,Robinhood to Plan Confidential IPO Filing as Soon as March,"(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets Inc., the trading platform behind the boom-and-bust swing in GameStop Corp.’s shares, plans to file confidentially for an initial public offering as soon as March, according to people familiar with the matter.The company has held talks in the past week with underwriters about moving forward with a filing within weeks, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No final decision has been made and the timing could change, the people said.Robinhood, which was valued at $11.7 billion in a funding round last year, raised financing this year that will convert to equity in an IPO. A first tranche will convert at a $30 billion valuation or a 30% discount to the IPO, whichever is lower, with the second at the lower of the 30% IPO discount or a $33 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported.A representative for Robinhood, based in Menlo Park, California, declined to comment.Robinhood exploded in popularity during the pandemic as homebound young people turned to its trading app to make money and pass the time. The company, which has been targeting a 2021 IPO since at least last year, encountered a cash crunch three weeks ago and since then has faced regulatory inquiries, including a hearing convened by the House Financial services Committee.Robinhood had to draw down its credit lines and raise $3.4 billion from its backers to post more collateral with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the industry’s clearinghouse. The DTCC wanted members to post more cash to ensure they could clear trades, given wild swings in stocks including video game retailer GameStop and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.Robinhood is also facing political and customer backlash because it temporarily curbed trading in GameStop and other stocks.Robinhood Financial said in a filing Friday that it’s in talks with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to settle an investigation regarding March 2020 app outages and options trading. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA are reviewing how Robinhood displays cash and buying power to customers and its options trading approval processes, according to the filing.The company has been considering selling some of its shares in its IPO directly to its own users, Bloomberg News reported. Such a move would be striking because retail investors usually don’t get to buy into new listings at the offering price. Instead, they typically have to invest on the first day of trading in a rush that can drive up the stock price.(Updates with FINRA review of 2020 issues in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",,"Benzinga

Source: Bruce Lee One Big Thing In Fintech: Although it’s still early in the transition, it appears the Biden administration will nominate former Ripple advisor and former U.S. Treasury Department official Michael Barr to head the OCC. In the short term, Trump’s SEC appointee, Commissioner Hester Pierce, will continue her notoriously crypto-friendly approach to the securities market. But the Biden administration is reportedly considering former CFTC chairman Gary Gensler to soon lead the SEC. “The new SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been pretty outspoken with his views on Facebook’s project Libra, as well as Ripple. It’s his opinion that those are securities and should be regulated by the SEC,” said attorney Hailey Lennon, a crypto-focused partner at Anderson Kill law firm. “In the next year or two, I hope some of the litigation we are seeing and new leadership in the SEC, will result in greater clarity so that down the road there are less enforcement actions. Clarity will help companies to know what to avoid.” Source: TechCrunch Other Key Fintech Developments: Celsius Network sees massive growth. Selling clients on bitcoin diversification.

In the coming sessions, participants will want to pay attention to the VWAP anchored from the $3,959.25 peak, the $3,720.50 minimal excess low, as well as the $3,837.75 high-volume area (HVNode). In the best case, the S&P 500 opens and remains above the $3,837.75 volume area. Auctioning above the VWAP anchored from the $3,959.25 peak would suggest buyers, on average, are in control and winning since the February 15 rally high. Any activity below the VWAP anchored from the $3,959.25 peak may leave the $3,837.75 HVNode as an area of supply — offering initiative sellers favorable entry and responsive buyers favorable exit.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk added $25 billion to his fortune in just one day, enabling him to close the gap with the world’s richest person and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. What Happened: Shares of Tesla gained nearly 20% in Tuesday’s regular session for its biggest jump in more than a year, as tech stocks rallied sharply on Wall Street amid falling bond yields. That resulted in Musk’s fortune rising by $25 billion and leading the gains among tech tycoons on Tuesday. Amazon’s shares rose 3.8%, helping Bezos gain $6 billion on the same day. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos’ net worth was $179.9 billion, followed by Musk with a net worth of $174.1 billion. The index is a ranking of the world’s 500 wealthiest people. Why It Matters: Bezos and Musk are engaged in an intense tussle for the top spot on the Bloomberg wealth index. Musk dethroned Bezos as the world’s richest person in January this year and his fortune touched $210 billion in the same month. See Also: Tesla’s February Sales Growth in China Shows ‘Major Directional Swing,’ Analyst Says However, Bezos regained the title of the world’s richest person after Tesla’s shares fell about 36% since then. Nevertheless, the gap between the two billionaires is now less than $6 billion. Price Action: Tesla shares closed 19.6% higher at $673.58 on Tuesday and rose almost 2.3% in the after-hours session. Amazon shares closed 3.8% higher at $3,062.85 and added another 0.10% in the after-hours session.
